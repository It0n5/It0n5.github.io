I am a tech veteran, and pivoted from an IT consulting role into the Cybersec space. This page will serve as a place to help other explorers, and offer tips along the hackers journey. 

Im quite passionate about tech and mental health, especially in the tech worker space.

I am also much more than just a curious breaker of things, I'm a father, a musician, and an advocate for improving attitudes in the workplace.

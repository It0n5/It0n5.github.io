Happy to have found a home for my research and notes, and can hopefully share. Setting up Jekyll for formatting has been pretty easy so far.

So this is going to be the home of all of my research, for better or for worse. I hope some of it helps someone out there, and if nothing else helps me remember a lot of things im working on.
